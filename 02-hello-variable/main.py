"""
Variables are used to store data values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Variables make it easier to reference data values in your code, rather than hardcoding the values directly and having
to update multiple values to make a change.

Challenge: Create a new variable called adjective and give it the value "big". Print "Hello, big World!" to the console using the variables.
