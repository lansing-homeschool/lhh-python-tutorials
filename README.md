# LHH Python Tutorials

## Getting started

If you are looking at this on GitHub, you probably need to clone the repository to your local machine. Learn how to do that from the video [here](https://youtu.be/ZDH0yjuSMhM) or the instructions [here](https://github.com/lansing-homeschool/lhh-github-intro). You will also need to install Python on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This tutorial is written for Python 3.12.6, but it should work with any version of Python 3.

The tutorials are organized in an order that progressively builds on the concepts learned in previous tutorials. You should attempt them in order. If you are already familiar with some of the concepts, you can skip ahead, but if you have difficulty with a later tutorial, you may need to go back and review the earlier ones.

To run the code in a tutorial folder, just run the Python command, followed by the name of the file. `main.py` is the name used to run the main program in each folder. For example, to run the code in the `00-hello-world` tutorial, you would det the current directory to `00-hello-world` and run `python main.py`.

```powershell
cd 00-hello-world
python main.py
```

You can also run commands in the Python console. Just type `python` in the command line to start the Python console. You can type Python commands directly into the shell. To exit the shell, type `exit()`.

## Challenge

Each tutorial has a challenge, written as comments in the code. Read the challenge and see if you can complete it.
